# Unity-Physics-Lab-Work-Immitation
Immitation of laboratory work in physics (theme: mechanics) I made on Unity as alternative to exam on the 1st course.

This programm allows to get experimental data for 2 laboratory works of physics faculty in Saint-Petersburg State Electrotechnical University. Labs full description can be found here (7н and 5н): http://physicsleti.ru/labs/Methodichki/1semestr/SheinmanLabMech2.pdf

You can download the attached .rar archieve to use this program. There is a known problem exists: app may not work with some browsers (Firefox, for example), but it definitely works with Microsoft Edge.
There is how to use this program:
1) Choose the body you want to work with by selecting it on the panel in the left down corner
2) Set neccessary inclination angle with slider on the right side (note that brick can not be rolled if inclination angle is less than 25 degrees)
3) Press "Пуск" button
4) Wait for body to finish its rolling
5) Right down time from timer in the right down corner
6) Press "Сброс" button
7) Repeat this all as much as you need.
